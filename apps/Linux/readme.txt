FITS 3D is a java application and so will require you to have Java8 installed on your machine to launch.  Java 8 can be downloaded form here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html.  

To run FITS 3D on Linux you must execute the appropriate shell script for your architecture.

ABOUT
===============
FITS 3D is a 3D visualiser for radio astronomy data.  It currently in development as part of my software engineering honours project. It is fairly rough around the edges so some bugs are to be expected. 

If you do encounter a particularly nasty bug or need help with the application feel free to contact me at chrishawkinsnz@gmail.com


or you can post an issue on the projects issue tracker:
