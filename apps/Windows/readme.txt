Requirements
===============
FITS 3D is a Java application and so will require you to have Java8 installed on your machine to launch.  Java 8 can be downloaded form here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html


=====================
SIMPLE (Small files) 
=====================
The simplest way to run the application is simply to double click the Fits3D.jar.  For most files (for instance the one supplied with the questionnaire) this version will suffice.  If you plan to use the app for larger files (usually those north of 1gb) it is recommended you use the advanced version.


======================
ADVANCED (Large files)
======================
Running the advanced version of the app is a slightly.  For windows users a script has been written that supports higher memory limits. This can be found in the "advanced (High Memory Mode)" folder

Unfortunately to execute this app you will need to have the Java Development Kit(JDK) installed.  The installer for the JDK can be found here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

ABOUT
===============
FITS 3D is a 3D visualiser for radio astronomy data.  It currently in development as part of my software engineering honours project. It is fairly rough around the edges so some bugs are to be expected. 

If you do encounter a particularly nasty bug or need help with the application feel free to contact me at chrishawkinsnz@gmail.com
